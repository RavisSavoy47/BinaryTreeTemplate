## BinaryTreeTemplate

A binaryTree is a data structure in which a record is linked to two successor records, usually referred to as the left branch when greater and the right when less than the previous record.

Create your own binaray tree by starting from the root. You can make the next insert higher or lower than the root. You can also remove a leaf(a single node) or you can remove the parent of the node. You can remove by starting from the root or the leafs.
